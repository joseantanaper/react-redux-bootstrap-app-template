# vite-template-redux

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to create a modern [React](https://react.dev/) app compatible with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

```sh
npx degit reduxjs/redux-templates/packages/vite-template-redux my-app
```
Note: many deprecated warnings on npm install
```sh
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-numeric-separator@7.18.6: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained. Please use @babel/plugin-transform-numeric-separator instead.
npm warn deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods@7.18.6: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained. Please use @babel/plugin-transform-private-methods instead.
npm warn deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties@7.18.6: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained. Please use @babel/plugin-transform-class-properties instead.

## Goals

- Easy migration from Create React App or Vite
- As beginner friendly as Create React App
- Optimized performance compared to Create React App
- Customizable without ejecting

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner

## Inspiration

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react)
- [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-lib)
